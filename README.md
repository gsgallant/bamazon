#Comments:

This app used NodeJS and MySQL and was strictly for the terminal.  Even so, I wanted to style it and used a few NPM packages to pull off a pretty well-styled result even if it was really just terminal output.

I used the NPM packages PAD and Colors and using PAD allowed me to create really nice tables and I believe that the results speak for themselves.
